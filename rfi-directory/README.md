## Information for Interested Vendors 

### We’re glad you’re interested in our project!

We’re developing a new way of working with the vendor community. We want to collaborate with vendors as a cross-functional product team, working on smaller modules, in the open, to iteratively improve the services FedRAMP provides. That means we will _not_ be pursuing a stand-alone, multi-year, monolithic contract that would take a long time to compete, and a long time for the vendor team to deliver working functionality.

The FedRAMP PMO envisions a transparent procurement process in which vendor teams compete for different modules as we define what’s needed to continue building the product. 

### So, what does this mean to the interested vendor community?

We intend this public GitHub repository to be the source of information as we move forward in our planning and implementation of this new vision.  We will do our best to keep this repo updated as decisions are made or if we need to pivot in our plans as we learn.  We also want to hear from the vendor community if you have any comments or questions - we will update this with specific instructions on how best to do that in the coming days.  We’ll do our best to respond to your questions as they arrive, but we also can’t guarantee we can answer every question.  

### Thanks again!
We hope you’ll join us in this.  If you’re interested or have questions, please send an e-mail [info@fedramp.gov] (mailto:info@fedramp.gov).
