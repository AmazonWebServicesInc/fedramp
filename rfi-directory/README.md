## Information for Interested Agencies 

### We’re glad you’re interested in our project!

In our efforts to help agencies continue to adopt secure cloud technologies, the GSA Secure Cloud Portfolio has been working to identify appropriate ways to create contract language agencies can use in the acquisition process for cloud services and in meeting FedRAMP requirements.

Federal policy has pushed forward a “Cloud First” mandate for agencies to default to purchasing cloud products and services for all new IT acquisitions. Additionally, agencies are required to ensure cloud providers meet the FedRAMP requirements when procuring and subsequently authorizing cloud services[^1]. We would like to help agencies acquire cloud services that can meet the FedRAMP requirements in a way that it is not prohibitive to competition and innovation.

The GSA Secure Cloud Portfolio is seeking feedback regarding industry experience with how agency attempts to enforce requirements via contract language. We hope to receive examples of both positive and problematic clauses so that we may develop better guidance that leads to better outcomes for both government and industry. We’re also looking for new and creative examples of industry suggested contract language that could be leveraged as well.

### So, what does this mean to the agency community?

We intend this public GitHub repository to be the source of collaboraton among agencies and the FedRAMP PMO as we move forward in our planning and implementation of this new vision.  We will do our best to keep this repo updated as decisions are made or if we need to pivot in our plans as we learn.  We also want to hear from the agency community if you have any comments or questions - we will update this with specific instructions on how best to do that in the coming days.  We’ll do our best to respond to your questions as they arrive, but we also can’t guarantee we can answer every question.  

### Thanks again!
We hope you’ll join us in this.  If you’re interested or have questions, please send an e-mail to [info@fedramp.gov] (mailto:info@fedramp.gov).
